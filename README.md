Pure Rust XDR bindings for Glusterfs
These bindings are autogenerated using [rust-xdr](https://github.com/jsgf/rust-xdr).  I took the .x files from Glusterfs's master
and cat'd them all together into one giant .x file.  I then fed that into rust-xdr and this is the result.  Gluster's XDR .x
files need some massaging to get working.  They're using some non standard syntax.  That is detailed here in this bug: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1336889
